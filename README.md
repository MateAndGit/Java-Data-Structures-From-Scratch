# Data Structures From Scratch

> **"What I cannot create, I do not understand."** – Richard Feynman

This repository is dedicated to implementing core data structures from scratch using **Java**. By building these from the ground up, I aim to achieve a deeper mastery of algorithmic efficiency and memory management.

## Project Objectives
* **Deep Dive**: Understand the 'under-the-hood' mechanics of Java collections.
* **Efficiency**: Analyze time and space complexity for each method.
* **Documentation**: Record implementation challenges and key takeaways.

## Linear Data Structures

 Structure | Key Methods |            Source Code            |
:--- | :--- |:---------------------------------:|
 **ArrayList** | `add`, `remove`, `get`, `resize` |         [🔗 View Code](./src/linear/MyArrayList.java)          |
 **LinkedList** | `addFirst`, `addLast`, `remove`, `search` | [🔗 View Code](./LinkedList.java) |
 **Stack** | `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty` |   [🔗 View Code](./Stack.java)    |
 **Queue** | `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek` |   [🔗 View Code](./Queue.java)    |
